## This is my first blog post

I will be backlogging a lot of the resources that I have learned. 
Today I will finish figuring out how to code Qiskit.
Tomorrow I submit my abstract for how to get students better resources to start coding in quantum computing.
My question now is, what is the difference between running a cloud-based quantum computer versus running a quantum simulator?
I can see running complex cloud-based projects being very useful, but right now I am just trying to do simple computations like `quantum teleportation`.
For something like this, I don't need to have the real deal quite yet.

In any case, here's a suggested example code block for me to get to know this new blogging system. 

 ```tsql
 SELECT *
 FROM sys.tables
 WHERE [name] = 'SomeTable'
 ```
